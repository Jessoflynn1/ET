Hi Can you please contact me ASAP @ Jessoflynn1@gmail.com I am in my final year in Univerisity of Limerick. Cyber Security.My Final year project is on automating sleep classifications using wireless wearable sleep sensors. I am just wondering if it would be okay to publish your code. It is very useful to me, I will acknowledge and reference your work of course. I am just looking for your data folder as the code will not run without it. Any help would be great thank you. I would just be comparing your machine learning approach to others and Deep learning. 
Thank you.
